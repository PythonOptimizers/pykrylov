PyKrylov
========

PyKrylov is a Python package implementing common Krylov methods in pure Python.


Requirements
============

1. `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ 2.3, 2.4 or 2.5. We are not sure about
   Python 2.6 compatibility and are pretty sure about incompatibility with
   Python 3.0.
2. `NumPy <http://www.scipy.org/NumPy>`_

If you are working under Linux, OS/X or Windows, prebuilt packages are
available. Remember that for efficiency, it is recommended to compile Numpy
against optimized LAPACK and BLAS libraries.


Krylov Methods
==============

Krylov methods are iterative methods for solving (potentially large)
systems of linear equations

        A x = b

where A is a matrix and x and b are vectors of compatible dimension. Different
Krylov methods are used depending on the properties of the matrix A. Typically,
only matrix-vector products with A are required at each iteration. Some methods
require matrix-vector products with the transpose of A when the latter is not
symmetric. For more information on Krylov methods, see for instance [Kelley]_.

PyKrylov does not rely on any particular dense or sparse matrix package because 
all matrix-vector products are handled as operators, i.e., the user supplies
a function to perform such products. Similarly, preconditioners are handled as
operators and are not held explicitly. As a result, PyKrylov should be easy to
use with dense Numpy array or matrices and with sparse matrix packages such as
those of `Pysparse <http://pysparse.sf.net>`_ and `Scipy
<http://www.scipy.org>`_.


Documentation
=============

PyKrylov documentation is based on the Sphinx system and can be regenerated by::

    cd doc
    make html
    make latex
    cd build/latex
    make all-pdf

The html documentation is in doc/build/html and the PDF manual is in
doc/build/latex. Obviously, if you don't have a working LaTeX distribution such
as TeXLive, only issue the first two commands.


Obtaining PyKrylov
==================

PyKrylov is hosted on `GitHub <http://www.github.com>`_. Head to
